# Vector and Matrix operations

## The aim of the project

Write a computer program containing
- Description of vect and matr classes containing fields
    - int dim,  // dimension
    - double\*a (double\*b),  // components of matrix and vector
    - int num,  // object number
    - static int count  // number of objects created by program;

- Constructors and destructors containing output of messages about the performed action and number of participating objects;
- A set of operator-functions (component and external) for operations of vector algebra containing output of messages about performed actions and numbers of participating objects:
(v - vector, m - matrix, -v(-m) - unary minus, k - coefficient)
    - v+v,
    - v-v,
    - -v,
    - v\*v,
    - k\*v,
    - v=v,
    - m+m,
    - m-m,
    - -m,
    - m\*m,
    - k\*m,
    - m=m.
- A main function that contains a vector and matrix scenario.
